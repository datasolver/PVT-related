Work in progress. Calculates gas compressibility factor for methane and helium using 
six different EOS

It can be expanded to accommodate more pure gases and even gas mixtures

Inputs:

    1. Input_Pressure = List of Pressures in bar
    2. Input_Temperature = List of Temperatures in Celsius
    3. EOS method
        - PR
        - PR-Peneloux
        - SRK
        - SRK-Peneloux
        - SBWR
        - Lee-Kesler
    4. Gas - only Methane and Helium
